This repository contains the code to create a quantum circuit using [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) and a Quantum Neural Network Model to classify encrypted images of handwritten digits using [TensorFlow Quantum](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum).

This code is based on my Medium article - [How to Classify Encrypted Data using a Quantum Neural Network Model?](https://pawarsaurav842.medium.com/what-is-quantum-machine-learning-and-how-to-create-a-quantum-neural-network-model-a59bd571021d)
