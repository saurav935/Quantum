# Quantum Machine Learning

This repository contains the code to create a quantum circuit using [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) and creating a Quantum Neural Network Model using [TensorFlow Quantum](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum).

This code is based on my Medium article - [What is Quantum Machine Learning and How to Create a Quantum Neural Network Model?](https://pawarsaurav842.medium.com/what-is-quantum-machine-learning-and-how-to-create-a-quantum-neural-network-model-a59bd571021d)
